# Fragile

FRAGILE
a platform & community focused on funding NPOs, social impact projects and public goods via purchasing collectibles (NFTs).

  1. FRAGILE works with selected NPOs on regular bases, creating a fundraising campaign for them on the platform. 
  2. FRAGILE campaign is a drop of limited recognizable badges (NFT's) available to purchase for a limited time.
  3. Each badge donates from 90-100% of its worth to a fundraiser (NPO) by its smart contract design.
  4. Ownership of these rare badges shows your contribution to the community.

Insight:
  1. Web3 community is spending $4B on Crypto Punks & Bored Ape for one reason- to show their status in the community.
We think that showing your status through luxury jpegs is broken, and your actual status is a real contribution you made.
  2. Gathering Web3 audience around the world's challenges and making donations easier and sexier can increase the efficiency and amount of money raised for impact makers in the real world. 
  3. Web3 contribution is far away from the real world. It more looks like real money is burning in metaverse shit, while the world is collapsing (I'm sorry for that pathos, but it's not far away from the truth)
  4. Buying something with a social impact purpose is easier to promote and share than a simple donation.
  
Goal:
1. Make your contributions towards ideas and social impact projects a new "status" symbol in the Web3 community.
